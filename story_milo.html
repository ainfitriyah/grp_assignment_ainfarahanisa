Ever wondered about the origins of MILO®? Here's the fun story behind MILO® — the origins of MILO® can be traced back to an ancient Greek myth! 
Imagine an individual so strong that they could lift a bull onto their shoulders. Well, it is said that in the 6th century B.C. lived Milo of Croton, an athlete strong enough to do just that! And it was with that strength, he successfully won six Olympic events and many other titles. 
A crisis presents opportunities, and innovation emerges under challenging circumstances, which is a vital catalyst that shapes the origins of MILO®. During The Great Depression in 1934, many children suffered from poor diets and malnutrition due to a shortage of food. These dire situations then inspired Nestlé Australia food scientist Thomas Mayne to develop a powdered chocolate malt drink designed to help build strength and provide energy for malnourished children. And in the spirit of Milo's myth came the brand and beverage that would eventually become an international household name, laying the foundations for the origins of MILO®. 
Today, MILO® is made in over 24 factories around the world and sold in more than 40 countries worldwide. Its unique choco-malty taste is widely loved by Malaysians, young and old alike. 
MILO® is the familiarity you seek in the morning for breakfast, the drink of your choice after playing sports and a great companion for late-night study sessions. Enjoy it cold and hot any time of the day, we’ve got a variety of creative MILO® recipes to give your energy a boost and your tastebuds a treat!
